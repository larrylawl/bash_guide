## What is this?

My source code for the Bash Guide for Beginners course offered by Machtelt Garrels. Concretely, I have finished the following exercises

1. Bash and Bash Scripts
2. The Bash Environment
3. Regular Expressions and `grep`
4. `sed`

Separately, I have implemented a bash script to set up a macbook from factory settings [here](https://github.com/larrylawl/set-up-mac).
